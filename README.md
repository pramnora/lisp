## Introduction

- LISP, is a *high level* programming language which was created in 1958. (Only FORTRAN is 1 year older.)   

- Notably, LISP makes extensive use of pairs of brackets: () to go around its code.   

- The original creator of the LISP/LISt-Processing programming language is: John McCarthy...;   
he was also the first person who coined the term: Artificial Intelligence.   

(The story goes that his book entitled: Automata Studies didn't manage to generate much interest; but, when he later renamed it: Artificial Intelligence; then, both academic circles/and, also, the general public became hugely interested.)  

- It is created to be used for AI-Artificial Intellence purposes.  (Other AI languages are: PROLOG/LOGO/-etc.)    

- It's said that John McCarthy's students created the first computer program to pay chess, convincingly.  

## LISP programming language variations

There are many different variations of LISP...

- CLISP  
- Common LISP   
- GNU LISP  
- LISP  
- NIL(New Implementation of Lisp)  
- Scheme  
- MacLisp  
- ZetaLisp  
- etc.  

### Lisp filename extension

The file name extension use for Lisp programs is: .lisp

## Linux Installation  

On Linux Ubuntu type...  

> apt install clisp    

In order to run CLISP type:  

> clisp  

...and, the CLISP REPL-Read Eval Print Loop should appear...ready for typing in/and, executing CLISP commands.  

In order to get help type:  

> :h

In order to exit CLISP type:   

> (exit)  

## CLISP code example
