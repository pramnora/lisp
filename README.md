# LISP 
Lisp programming code  

## Introduction

- The original creator of the LISP/LIS-Processing programming language is: John McCarthy...;   
he was also the first person who coined the term: Artificial Intelligence.  

- LISP, is a *high level* programming language which was created in 1958. (Only FORTRAN is 1 year older.)  

- It is created to be used for AI-Artificial Intellence purposes.  (Other AI languages are: PROLOG/LOGO/-etc.)    

- Notably, LISP makes extensive use of pairs of brackets: () to go around its code.   

There are many different variations of LISP...

- LISP  
- CLISP  
- GNU LISP  
- Common LISP   
- Scheme  
- etc.  

## My own personal interest in learning how to use LISP  

- First, I started off by learning to use BASIC/Beginner's All purpose Symbollic Instruction Code. 

- Later, I studied using more of the BASIC family: QBASIC/VBScript/Visual BASIC 6.0.    

- Next, I moved on to learning to use, Pascal...which is a far more 'technical' language than was the much simpler and straight forwards, BASIC. 

- After than I learned to use some: HTML/CSS/Javascript.  

However, there are certain programming languages which I still don't understand how to use, yet...?  

- Amongst these programming languages are, namely: C/C++...; both very highly 'technical' languages.  
  
- I also never really learned how to use the AI-Artificial Intelligence languages including: LISP/PROLOG/LOGO(though, I have done some very elementary LOGO programming before). 

- In addition to which I will admit...there are, quite literally, 100's and 100's of programming languages which I still have tried using, yet;  
including, the *older* languages: Smalltalk/FORTRAN/COBOL/-etc.; and, even, *newer* languages: Angular/React/SVelte/RUST/Go/Erlang/-etc.  

- Also, as I hardly ever worked on Mac OS before...; therefore, I really don't know such languages as, Swift/-etc.  

## Linux Installation  

On Linux Ubuntu type...  

> apt install clisp    

In order to run CLISP type:  

> clisp  

...and, the CLISP REPL-Read Eval Print Loop should appear...ready for typing in/and, executing CLISP commands.  

In order to get help type:  

> :h

In order to exit CLISP type:   

> (exit)  

## CLISP code example  

### Example 1  

> (+ 1 2)  
> 3

### Example 2  

> (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)  
> 55
